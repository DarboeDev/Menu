The Menu Project demonstrates how to build a dynamic menu application using React. It consists of two main components:

* Menu: This component displays the list of menu items based on the selected category. It receives the filtered menu items as props and maps over them to render each item.

* Category: The Category component renders interactive buttons representing different categories. Users can click on these buttons to filter the menu items. It receives the list of available categories as well as the filterItem function as props to handle the filtering logic.

* The application utilizes the useState hook to manage the filtered menu items and categories.
